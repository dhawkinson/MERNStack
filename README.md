## Full Stack React/Redux & Node

## Technologies included

* ES6+ Syntax
* Async/Await
* React Hooks
* Redux with DevTools
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* Testing server side with Postman HTTP Client
* Mongoose / MongoDB / Atlas
* Bcrypt Password Hashing
* Github API data consumption
* Git & Heroku Deployment

---
This is an exercise that utilizes the full stack. Routes are defined and executed using Node & Express on the server side. The user interface is executed on the client side with React and Redux.

The app is a way for developers to connect with each other and share information about themselves.

### Note to Interested Parties

Since this app is full stack the approach is as follows:

* The app is two-tiered in its approach, server-side/client-side.
* The app was created with the server as the root.
* The package.json and package-lock.json files, and the node_modules folder and content in the root, pertain primarily to server-side functionality.
* The client is a folder within the root
  * The client was created using create-react-app
  * the files .git, .gitignore and README.md were deleted from the client folder as being superceded by those same files in the root folder

* The package.json and package-lock.json files, and the node_modules folder and content in the client folder, pertain client-side functionality.
